# Northeastern-University-CoE-Final-Project-Surveillance-Robot
This is a robot I have worked on with Sergio Loza, John O'Donnel. It is a surveillance robot that is coded on a Raspberry Pi 4B, with the Legacy Camera
When coding this project, I added upon my NULondon Robotics Club repository, which is where the actual repository is located for this project. This github repo however serves to distinguish the two projects from another, as they are two seperate projects.
